Challenge Submitter: The Emergency Management Agency (EMA) of Allegheny County

**The Challenge**

Natural disasters can wreak havoc on buildings, roads, and, most importantly, people's lives. The EMA is deployed to the scene following a natural disaster in Allegheny County to assess the impact and help get people's lives back together with paper and pencil in hand. The team at the EMA seeks a digital way to intake and calculate the data in the field to increase accuracy, decrease human errors, and secure funding faster so that the people and communities affected can start rebuilding faster.

The primary goal was to provide a more modern approach to creating, retrieving and updating the forms that the EMA uses.

2. Partial and case-insensitive search of existing records.
3. Support for image uploads and updates, with server-side validation.
